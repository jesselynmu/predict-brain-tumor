# Prediction Brain Tumor Using MRI Picture
One of the important organs in the human body is the brain. The brain plays many roles in human life. With the brain, humans can receive information and perform activities because the brain is the central nervous system of humans. However, like other organs, the brain certainly has dangerous diseases. One of the dangerous brain diseases is brain tumors. There are 4 types of brain tumors, namely glioma, meningioma, notumor, and pituitary. To obtain images of brain tumors, an MRI can be performed. However, MRI cannot directly classify the types of brain tumors. Therefore, a system is needed that can classify the types of brain tumors. One suitable method for classification is KNN. This classification also requires features, so thresholding and edge detection methods, namely Canny Segmentation and Sobel Segmentation, are used to obtain the number of white pixels. The research results prove that the methods used are quite good with an accuracy value of 75.85%, precision value of 75.13%, recall value of 75.34%, and F1 Score value of 0.75.
